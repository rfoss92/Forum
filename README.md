# Forum

This is a basic template for a forum.

It's built using PHP and MySQL, which I learned from reading "PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites" by Larry Ullman.

It allows users to create a login, reset passwords, create threads, and post in threads. By utilizing hashing and filters, it allows for secure logins and prevents against SQL injections.
